# Litter Robot Proxy — Home Assistant App

This is a local MQTT proxy for **Litter Robot 3 Connect** devices. It intercepts UDP communication between your robots and Whisker's servers and publishes status to Home Assistant via MQTT Discovery without polling the Whisker API. Whisker app control still uses the cloud.

## How it works

The DNS rewrite directs the robot's traffic for `dispatch.prod.iothings.site` to this app. The app listens on UDP ports 2000 and 2001 and sits in the middle:

```
LR3 → (DNS rewrite) → This app → Whisker servers (upstream relay)
                             ↓
                      MQTT Discovery
                             ↓
                     Home Assistant entities
```

The robots continue communicating with Whisker normally — the Whisker app keeps working. You simply gain real-time local visibility on top. *Note that this does NOT allow for robot **control**, only robot monitoring.*

## Prerequisites

- **Mosquitto broker** app installed in Home Assistant.
- **AdGuard Home** (or another local DNS server) to redirect robot DNS queries. *This might also be possible directly on your router, if you know how.*
- A robot using the older plaintext UDP dispatch protocol. Some LR3 hardware
  uses AWS IoT/TLS; an AWS DNS lookup alone does not rule out concurrent UDP
  traffic. Confirm each robot's UDP behavior before adding the rewrite. See
  [REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md](REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md).

## Installation

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Apps → Install App**
2. Click the **⋮** menu → **Repositories**
3. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/fedstar/home-assistant-apps`
4. Find **Litter Robot Proxy** and click **Install**

## Required: DNS Rewrite

Your Litter Robot 3 devices must resolve `dispatch.prod.iothings.site` to your Home Assistant IP address instead of Whisker's servers.

**In AdGuard Home:**
1. Go to **Filters → DNS Rewrites**
2. Click **Add DNS Rewrite**
3. Domain: `dispatch.prod.iothings.site`
4. Answer: `<your Home Assistant IP>`

**Your IoT VLAN must also use AdGuard for DNS.** In your router/controller, set the DHCP DNS server for your IoT network to your AdGuard IP (if you use a VLAN).

After adding the rewrite, power cycle your Litter Robot(s). Check the AdGuard query log to confirm the robots' DNS queries show as **Rewritten**.

## Configuration

```yaml
mqtt_host: "core-mosquitto"   # Use 'core-mosquitto' for the Mosquitto app
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_user: ""                  # Your MQTT username
mqtt_pass: ""                  # Your MQTT password
offline_threshold: 600         # Seconds before a robot is marked offline (default: 10 min)
capture_packets: false         # Optional protocol capture; see below
robots:
  - name: "Litter Robot 1"    # Friendly name shown in Home Assistant
    ip: "192.168.1.101"       # Static IP of this robot on your network
    capacity: 25              # Number of cycles before showing 100% (default is 30 if left blank)
  - name: "Litter Robot 2"
    ip: "192.168.1.102"
  - name: "Litter Robot 3"
    ip: "192.168.1.103"
```

> **Tip:** Assign static DHCP leases to your Litter Robots in your router so their IPs never change.

> **Note:** At least one robot IP and name are required by the current app configuration. Device IDs are learned from traffic if omitted.

## Entities created per robot

The app uses MQTT Discovery to automatically create the following entities in Home Assistant, grouped under a single device per robot:

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Status | Sensor | Ready / Cleaning / Waiting / Complete / Paused / Cat Interrupted / Almost Full / Nearly Full / Full / Bonnet Removed / Cat Sensor Fault / Offline / Off |
| Drawer Level | Sensor | Estimated fill percentage based on cycle count |
| Cycle Count | Sensor | Number of cleaning cycles since last reset |
| Wait Time | Sensor | Configured wait time in minutes |
| Drawer Full | Binary Sensor | On when status is DF1, DF2, or DFS |
| Error | Binary Sensor | On when any error condition is active |
| Night Light | Binary Sensor | Night light on/off state |
| Panel Lock | Binary Sensor | Panel lock on/off state |
| Sleep Mode | Binary Sensor | Sleep mode on/off state |
| Reset Drawer Counter | Button | Resets cycle count to zero for this robot |

## Drawer level calibration

The drawer level percentage is estimated from cycle count divided by a configurable capacity (default: 30 cycles). This default is a reasonable starting point but varies based on:

- Number of cats using each robot
- Litter depth
- Cat size

To calibrate per robot:
1. Empty a drawer and press **Reset Drawer Counter**
2. Note the cycle count when the robot reports `DF1` (drawer full warning)
3. That number is your robot's actual capacity

30 cycles is a conservative default that will trend toward showing fuller than reality rather than missing a full drawer. The number of cycles can be configured for each robot in the UI.

## Offline detection

If a robot stops reporting for longer than `offline_threshold` seconds (default 10 minutes), its Status sensor changes to `Offline` and the Error binary sensor turns on. When the robot comes back online, status updates automatically.

## Experimental protocol capture

Set `capture_packets: true` in the app configuration and restart the app to
record LR3 UDP packets for local-control research. The capture is **off by
default**. It only observes traffic; the app remains a monitoring proxy and
does not send local control commands.

Exact packet bytes, timestamps, endpoints, and tentative parsed fields are
written to the app's private `/data/captures/packets.jsonl` file. The file is
limited to 20 MiB and five rotated backups. Server command packets also appear
in the app log as `LR3_CAPTURE` JSON lines. You can copy those lines from the
app log and inspect them with `python3 capture_inspect.py app.log`. See
[REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md](REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md) for the night-light experiment
and annotation format. Review captures before sharing them: they include robot
device identifiers.

## Troubleshooting

**Robots not appearing in Home Assistant:**
- Check the app log for connection messages
- Verify the DNS rewrite is active in AdGuard
- Confirm robots are using AdGuard for DNS (check AdGuard query log for robot IPs)
- Power cycle the robots after setting up the DNS rewrite

**Drawer level not incrementing:**
- The cycle count only increments on `CCC` (cycle complete) events
- Verify the robot is completing full cycles (not being interrupted)

**Whisker app stopped working:**
- The proxy app relays all traffic to Whisker's servers transparently
- If the Whisker app stops working, check the proxy app log for upstream relay errors
- The Whisker app's reliability depends on Whisker's cloud infrastructure

## Notes

- Cycle counts persist across app restarts in `/data/cycles.json`
- The app does **not** send commands to the robots — monitoring only
- This app is not affiliated with Whisker or Litter Robot
